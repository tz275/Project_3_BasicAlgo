In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. 
The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

Because our expected run time complexity is O(n).
def get_min_max(ints):
     s, l = -inf, inf

     for i in ints:
        if i < s:
            renew s
        if i > l:
            renew l
    return (s, l)

Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n) because there is only one loop in the function.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) because the number of created variables is constant.
